Building and running the application
------------------------------------

*Note: if you don't have installed gradle - you can use wrappers in each module*
 
Building and running authorization server:
 ------------------------------------------
 
* Go into the `auth-server` package
* Specify you database credentials in `application.yml` properties file
* Call `./gradlew bootRun` or start spring boot application in your preferred IDE
* During first startup application admin account should be created. 
You could check by requesting access token for the admin using password grant flow: 
```
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:7777/oauth/token \
  -H 'Authorization: Basic ZmVzLWNsaWVudDphSHtHX3tdKTZ5W2o4YXBGenFhUkotQmJ3cEFie2M/LzRQLXhDWywyeU48bTk0WTk=' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'username=fes-admin%40gmail.com&password=admin&grant_type=password'
```

Building and running main server application:
 ------------------------------------------
 * Go into the `server-app` package
 * Specify you database credentials and admin account credentials in `application.yml` properties file
 * Call `./gradlew bootRun` or start spring boot application in your preferred IDE
 * Start using resource server API attaching previously requested Bearer-Token in each request.
